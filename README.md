# project2

This project uses the Meteorite_Landings.csv file as the data set. The FallenStars.java file is the Driver class.

In the FallenStars class, there are 3 queries (mass, year, location). 

The mass query gives a list of the Meteorites that are within 10 grams of the mass the user inputs.

The year query gives a list of the Meteorites that fell to Earth on the year the user inputs.

The location gives a single Meteorite that is closest to the location the user inputs.

Note: The Meteorite_Landing.csv file is too large for all Meteorites to be accounted for.
